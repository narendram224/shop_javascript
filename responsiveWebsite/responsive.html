                <p>Lorem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used in laying out print,
                     graphic or web designs. The passage is attributed to an unknown typesetter in the 15th century 
                     who is thought to 
                    have scrambled parts of Cicero's De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum for use in a type specimen book.</p>

                <p>In publishing and graphic design, Lorem ipsum is a placeholder text commonly used to demonstrate the visual
                     form of a document or a typeface without relying on
                     meaningful content. Lorem ipsum may be used as a placeholder before final copy is available. Wikipedia</p>

                <p>t is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when
                     looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution
                      of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. 
                      Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have 
                    evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>

                <p>text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a
                    type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
                    typesetting, r and more recently with desktop publishing software
                    like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered
                    alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly
                    believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't
                    anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet

                <p> ntrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
                    classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin
                    professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
                    consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical
                    literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33
                    of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This
                    book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of
                    Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
